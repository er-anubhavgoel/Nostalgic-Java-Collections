# Nostalgic Java Collections

The **Java Collections Framework (JCF)** is a powerful architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. It provides interfaces and classes that allow developers to manage data structures efficiently.

### Key Components of Java Collections:

- **List (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector)** – Ordered collection, allows duplicates.
- **Set (HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet)** – Unordered collection, unique elements.
- **Map (HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap)** – Key-value pairs, fast lookups.
- **Queue (PriorityQueue, LinkedList)** – Follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.

This repository, **Nostalgic Java Collections**, is dedicated to exploring and implementing real-world projects using ***Java’s Collections Framework***. Each project showcases different aspects of **sorting**, **filtering**, and **managing data** using Java collections.

## Project 1: Shirt Inventory Management System 📂

### Introduction:

The **Shirt Inventory Management System** is a menu-driven Java application designed to manage a collection of shirts efficiently. It utilizes Java's Collections Framework to perform various operations such as sorting, filtering, and counting shirts based on their attributes.

### Project Implementation:

- Uses **ArrayList** to store `Shirt` objects dynamically.
- Implements **sorting with Comparator** for price-based ordering.
- Utilizes **Map Interface** for counting operations (shirts by brand, size, and color).
- Provides a **menu-driven interface** for user interaction.

### Menu-Driven Functionalities:

✅ View all shirts in inventory\
✅ Filter shirts by brand, size, price, and color\
✅ Sort shirts based on price (low to high & high to low)\
✅ List available brands and sizes\
✅ Count shirts by brand, size, and color

## Project 2: Car Management System ⚙️

### Introduction:

The **Car Management System** is a menu-driven Java application designed to efficiently manage a collection of cars. It leverages Java's Collections Framework to facilitate operations such as sorting, filtering, and counting cars based on various attributes.

### Project Implementation:

- Uses **ArrayList** to store `Car` objects dynamically.
- Implements **sorting with Comparator** for price-based and manufacturing year ordering.
- Utilizes **Set** to store unique car brands.
- Uses **Map Interface** to count cars based on brand, manufacturing year, and color.
- Provides a **menu-driven interface** for user interaction.

### Menu-Driven Functionalities:

✅ Insert a new car into the inventory\
✅ Display all cars in inventory\
✅ Filter cars based on brand, price, color, and manufacturing year\
✅ Sort cars by price (low to high & high to low)\
✅ Sort cars by manufacturing year (newest to oldest)\
✅ List available car brands\
✅ Count cars based on brand, manufacturing year, and color
