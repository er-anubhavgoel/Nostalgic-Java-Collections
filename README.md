# **Nostalgic Java Collections**  

The **Java Collections Framework (JCF)** is a powerful architecture for storing and manipulating a group of objects. It provides interfaces and classes that allow developers to manage data structures efficiently.  

### **Key Components of Java Collections**  
- **List (ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector)** â€“ Ordered collection, allows duplicates.  
- **Set (HashSet, TreeSet, LinkedHashSet)** â€“ Unordered collection, unique elements.  
- **Map (HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap)** â€“ Key-value pairs, fast lookups.  
- **Queue (PriorityQueue, LinkedList)** â€“ Follows FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.  

This repository, **Nostalgic Java Collections**, is dedicated to exploring and implementing real-world projects using Javaâ€™s **Collections Framework**. Each project showcases different aspects of **sorting, filtering, and managing data using Java collections**.

## **Project 1: Shirt Inventory Management System** ðŸ“‚  

### **Introduction**  
The **Shirt Inventory Management System** is a **menu-driven** Java application designed to manage a collection of shirts efficiently. It utilizes Java's **Collections Framework** to perform various operations such as **sorting, filtering, and counting** shirts based on their attributes.  

### **Project Implementation**  
- Uses **ArrayList** to store Shirt objects dynamically.  
- Implements **sorting with Comparator** for price-based ordering.  
- Utilizes **Map Interface** for counting operations (shirts by brand, size, and color).  
- Provides a **menu-driven interface** for user interaction.  

### **Menu-Driven Functionalities**  
âœ… **View all shirts in inventory**  
âœ… **Filter shirts by brand, size, price, and color**  
âœ… **Sort shirts based on price (low to high & high to low)**  
âœ… **List available brands and sizes**  
âœ… **Count shirts by brand, size, and color**
